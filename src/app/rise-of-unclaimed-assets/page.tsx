              <b>The Shocking Statistics:</b> Unclaimed Assets in India states
              that the scale of unclaimed assets in India is indeed impressive.
            </li>
            <b>Let’s look at the numbers:</b>
            <li>
              <b>Banking Sector:</b> In its annual report, RBI commented that
              unclaimed deposits in banks rose by 26% to Rs. 78,213 crore till
              March 2024.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Investor Education and Protection Fund: </b> Unclaimed
              dividends and interest IEPF had until July 2023 was of an amount
              of Rs. 5,714 crore. But it does not include the amount of
              unclaimed shares.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Unclaimed Shares: </b> A recent research on 1,561 listed
              companies had indicated that as of August 2024, unclaimed shares
              worth an astonishing Rs.1,00,000 crore were transferred to the
              IEPF.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mutual Funds: </b> Around Rs. 35,000 crore remains unclaimed in
              mutual fund investments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Employee Provident Fund: </b> The EPFO is believed to hold
              around Rs. 27,000 crore in unclaimed funds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>These numbers make for a clear example: </b>There are well over
              Rs 8 lakh crore ($100 Bn) in unclaimed assets in India, which is
              quite a sizeable portion of this country’s wealth lying idle
            </li>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
              What explains the rise in unclaimed assets?
            </h2>
            <p>
              There are several reasons why the reserve of unclaimed assets is
              increasing.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Lack of awareness: </b> Most people do not know that some
              investments have been made on their behalf or that there are
              forgotten accounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Poor record keeping:</b>
              Some financial institutions cannot trace the original owners due
              to poor records and outdated contact information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Inheritance complexity: </b> Issues involving deceased account
              holders usually involve complex procedures that lawfully entitled
              heirs often find quite challenging to undertake.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Movement: </b> People move within the country or out of the
              country, and they lose touch with their investments or fail to
              update their contact details.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Regulatory changes:</b> Rapid changes in financial regulations
              result in confusion and sometimes inadvertently lead to
              non-compliance.
