            In an era where technology is virtually transforming every facet of our existence, the financial sector is no different. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a strong innovation in the context of unclaimed investments and financial asset recovery. This new technology not only streamlines procedures but also transforms our approach to investor protection and the recovery of overlooked funds.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Understanding Unclaimed Investments</h2>
            <p>
            Before we talk about the AI revolution , it is important to define what is known as unclaimed investments:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>Dormant bank accounts</li>
              <li>Lost mutual fund units</li>
              <li>Unclaimed insurance policies</li>
              <li>Abandoned stock holdings</li>
              <li>Overlooked provident fund accounts</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            These assets, usually lost due to address changes, lack of information, or plain forgetfulness, total billions of unclaimed wealth globally.
