            Role of the IEPF Authority
            </h2>
            <p>
            The IEPF Authority governs the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This fund is to support investor education and safeguarding of investors’ rights. The Authority ensures the process of transferring unclaimed dividends, matured deposits and other financial assets in one’s name to IEPF and subsequently reverted to investors.

            Regulation of the IEPF Authority
            </h2>
            <p>
            The IEPF Authority functions on the basis of the regulatory provision of the Companies Act, 2013. The Act under its Section 125, mandates the transfer of all unclaimed dividends, matured deposits, and other financial instruments lying with a company to the IEPF after a specified period. Further, the right of such amount can also be returned by the IEPF Authority on receiving an application from the entitled persons. The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999, incorporating the concept of IEPF had further enhanced the existing regulation with better protection to investor rights.
