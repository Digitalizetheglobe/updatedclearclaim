              In India, many investors unknowingly miss out on dividends,
              matured deposits, or shares transferred to the Investor Education
              and Protection Fund (IEPF). If you’re among those with unclaimed
              dividends or shares, there’s good news — you can reclaim your
              assets! This blog walks you through the process of IEPF recovery
              and highlights how professional services, like Clearclaim,
              simplify the journey.

              1. Understanding IEPF: What Is It and Why Assets Are Transferred?

            <ul>
              <li>
                IEPF is a government initiative to protect investors’ interests.
                If dividends, shares, or deposits remain unclaimed for seven
                consecutive years, companies transfer them to the IEPF. This
                ensures idle assets don’t get misused but are available for
                rightful owners to reclaim at any time.
              </li>

              <li>Typical reasons for unclaimed assets include:</li>
              <li>
                1. Investors forgetting to update bank details or addresses.

              <li>2. Lost share certificates or DEMAT account issues.</li>
              <li>
                3. Ownership disputes or lack of awareness among nominees.
