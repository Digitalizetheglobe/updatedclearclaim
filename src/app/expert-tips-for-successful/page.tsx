              1.Verify Eligibility Before Filing a Claim
            </h2>
            <p>
              Before initiating a claim, confirm your eligibility. Shares or
              dividends transferred to IEPF usually belong to accounts where no
              activity occurred for seven consecutive years. If you are the
              legal heir or nominee, ensure you have proof of ownership or
              succession. Identifying your eligibility upfront prevents delays
              and unnecessary paperwork.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
              2. Organize Required Documentation Thoroughly
            </h2>
            <p>
              IEPF claims require a host of documents, such as identity proofs,
              share certificates, and bank statements. If you’re a nominee or
              legal heir, additional legal documents like succession
              certificates or affidavits may be needed. Experts recommend
              compiling all necessary documents in advance to avoid last-minute
              scrambling.

              3. Rectify Name or Address Discrepancies{" "}
            </h2>
            <p>
              A common cause for claim rejection is discrepancies between the
              name or address on the records and your current identification
              documents. For instance, changes due to marriage or spelling
              errors can cause rejections. It’s essential to resolve these
              mismatches by updating your KYC or providing notarized affidavits.

              4 . Utilize Professional Help for Complex Claims

            <p>
              If your case involves missing share certificates, complex nominee
              disputes, or incomplete records, seeking professional assistance
              is advisable. Claims management services like Clearclaim have

              5. Stay Updated with Regulatory Changes
            </h2>
            <p>
              IEPF rules and procedures can evolve, impacting how claims are
              processed. Experts recommend staying informed about the latest
              regulatory updates and policy changes. Professionals such as

              6. Track Your Claim Regularly

            <p>
              Once the claim is submitted, regularly follow up on its status
              with the IEPF authorities. Monitoring progress ensures that you
              can address any queries or document requirements immediately,
              reducing delays. Professionals often automate this tracking
              process, ensuring timely updates and faster resolutions.

              Simple mistakes—like incomplete forms, wrong attachments, or
              missing notarizations—can lead to claim rejections. Pay close
              attention to details when filling out forms or compiling
              documents. Hiring experts ensures that these common pitfalls are
              avoided, as they thoroughly review submissions for accuracy.
