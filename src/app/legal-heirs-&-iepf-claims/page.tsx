              Why do ancestral shares keep landing into the IEPF?
            </h2>

            <li>
              There are several reasons for the tidal wave of unclaimed shares,
              Some heirs do not know about their ancestors’ investments. Old
              documents or missing nomination details create a sea of
              complications. The labyrinthine nature of inheritance may confuse
              many families. Emigrating families may lose track of ancestral
              investments. Constant updates in regulations confuse many more.
