            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What Are Unclaimed Dividends?</h2>

            <p>
            Unclaimed dividends are the distributions of a companys profit which have been issued to shareholders but remain uncollected. This can occur because of:
            </p>
           
           <p>
           Change in investors address

<p>
On the other hand, unclaimed shares are equity participation in a company that an investor has forgotten or lost track of. This may be due to:
</p>

            Failure to dematerialize physical share certificates
Loss of share certificates
Forgotten investments from the past
