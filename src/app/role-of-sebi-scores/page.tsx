              This blog explores how SEBI SCORES (SEBI Complaints Redress
              System) plays a critical role in ensuring transparency and
              resolution in IEPF claims and simplifying the overall experience
              for investors.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What is SEBI SCORES?</h2>
            <p>
              SEBI’s SCORES platform is a centralized online grievance redressal
              system aimed at resolving investor complaints against listed
              companies, mutual funds, brokers, and other financial
              intermediaries. Since the process of claiming dividends, shares,
              or financial assets from IEPF involves interaction with companies,
              SEBI SCORES becomes essential for addressing delays,
              miscommunication, or discrepancies during this process.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
              How SEBI SCORES Assists in IEPF Claims
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
                1. Centralized Complaint Filing:
              </h2>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Investors or their nominees can register complaints online on the
              SEBI SCORES portal if there are delays in claim approvals from
              companies or the IEPF authority.
            </p>
            <p>
              All communication and complaint tracking happen through a single
              dashboard, ensuring no communication gap between the claimant and
              the concerned company{" "}
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Escalation Mechanism:</h2>
            <p>
              If companies fail to process IEPF-related claims promptly,
              investors can escalate the issue to SEBI through SCORES.
            </p>
            <p>
              SEBI ensures companies respond and take timely action, holding
              them accountable for any lapses in their responsibilities.{" "}
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Ensuring Transparency:</h2>
            <p>
              The portal provides real-time status updates, giving claimants
              visibility into the progress of their complaint.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clear timelines are set for companies to address grievances,
              bringing transparency into an otherwise complex process.{" "}

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
              How SEBI and IEPF Work Together for Claims Resolution
            </h2>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Company Verification: </h2>
            <p>
              When an IEPF claim is initiated, the company that transferred the
              asset to the IEPF is responsible for verifying the claimant’s
              details.
            </p>
            <p>
              In many cases, delays occur at this verification stage. SEBI
              SCORES plays a vital role by enabling investors to report delays
              and request timely follow-ups.{" "}
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Monitoring Compliance:</h2>
            <p>
              SEBI ensures companies meet their obligations, such as verifying
              claims and forwarding them to the IEPF. The companies’ performance
              is tracked through SCORES, and non-compliance can lead to
              penalties.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
              3. Support for Legal Heirs:
            </h2>
            <p>
              Claims involving transmission (when the original investor is
              deceased) often require legal documentation like a succession
              certificate. SEBI SCORES becomes especially helpful in cases where
              companies delay or complicate the verification process for legal
              heirs.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
              Collaboration with IEPF Authority:{" "}
            </h2>
            <p>
              While SEBI does not directly release IEPF refunds, it works in
              conjunction with the IEPF Authority to ensure companies forward
              verified claims on time. This collaboration ensures smoother
              resolution for claimants.

              Challenges in IEPF Claims and How SEBI SCORES Helps{" "}
            </h2>

            <p>
              Delays in Verification: Companies sometimes take longer than
              expected to verify documents. Claimants can register a complaint
              on SCORES to expedite the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Incomplete Documentation: If companies request additional
              documents or reject claims without valid reasons, SEBI can
              intervene through the SCORES platform.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Inconsistent Communication: SCORES serves as a single point of
              communication, reducing the frustration of following up with
              companies through multiple channels.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Long Claim Process: The IEPF claim process can take 6 to 12
              months. SEBI ensures companies do not unnecessarily prolong their
              part of the verification.{" "}
