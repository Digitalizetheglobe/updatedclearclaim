            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The Unclaimed NRI Assets Size</h2>
            <p>Unclaimed assets can take various forms, such as:</p>
            {/* <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Dividends and Shares</h2> */}
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li>Dormant bank accounts</li>
              <li>Neglected mutual fund investments</li>
              <li>Unclaimed shares and dividends</li>
              <li>Matured insurance policies</li>
              <li>Provident fund accounts</li>
            </ul>

<p>These funds, so easily forgotten in the process of migration, lack of knowledge, or simple oversight, represent a significant amount of money that rightly belongs to NRIs.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Recent Changes in Regulations Affecting NRIs</h2>
            <p>The cross-border asset recovery landscape is also dynamic, with new legislation to facilitate the process and promote compliance. The major developments are:</p>


            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Enhanced Tax Recovery Provisions</h2>
            <p>The Indian revenue authority has been empowered to recover tax arrears from the assets of non-residents in India. This provision ensures tax arrears collection even if the person is abroad, thereby enhancing compliance and preventing tax evasion.</p>


            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. More Stringent Exit Rules</h2>
            <p>Departing non-residents are now asked to produce their Permanent Account Number (PAN), the reason for going abroad, and the duration of stay abroad. Tax authorities have the right to bar departure in case of any outstanding tax dues.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Withholding Tax on Non-Resident Income</h2>
            <p>All the taxable income earned by a non-resident in India will be taxed by way of deduction at source (TDS) so that tax compliance is obtained at the receipt of income.</p>


            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Challenges of Cross-Border Asset Recovery</h2>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">NRIs face several challenges while attempting to recover unclaimed assets</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li>Jurisdictional Challenges: The spread of assets among many different nations may lead to conflicting rules and procedures.</li>
              <li>Documentation Requirements: Providing necessary proof of ownership and identity can be challenging, especially for long-dormant accounts.</li>
              <li>Regulatory Compliance: It takes skill to navigate the complex web of global financial regulations and tax treaties.</li>
              <li>Currency Fluctuations: The exchange value of recovered assets could be affected by the variation in exchange rates over time.</li>
              <li>Time Limitations: There are jurisdictions that have imposed time limitations to claim dormant assets, creating pressure on the process of recovery.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">New initiatives and solutions.</h2>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Structure of Cross-Border Insolvency</h2>
            <p>The use of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in India provides a systematized means of dealing with cases of insolvency spanning multiple jurisdictions. It is especially suited for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) facing financial distress involving properties or creditors geographically dispersed over several jurisdictions.</p>


            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Digital Platforms and Online Search Facilities</h2>
            <p>
            A number of financial institutions and regulatory bodies now provide convenient online facilities meant to assist NRIs in tracking and claiming their inactive assets.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. India's membership in the Asset Recovery Interagency Network-Asia Pacific (ARIN-AP)</h2>
            <p>steering committee, and intentions to take up the presidency in 2026, reflect the country's interest in furthering cooperation in the fight against economic crimes and global asset recovery.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Advance Rulings for Non-Resident Indians</h2>
            <p>The availability of advance rulings facilitates Non-Resident Indians to ascertain their tax liability prior to entering into transactions with residents of India, minimizing potential future dispute and allowing greater certainty for financial planning.</p>


            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Easy Tax Compliance</h2>
            <p>NRIs can be exempted from the requirement to file income tax returns if their overall income is limited to investment income or long-term capital gains, and tax being deducted at source, making it easy to comply.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Best Practices for NRIs</h2>
            <p>In order to effectively deal with the intricacies of cross-border asset recovery, NRIs must follow the following strategies:</p>
