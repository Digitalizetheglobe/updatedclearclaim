            <p>
            Inactive financial assets, also referred to as dormant or unclaimed assets, are financial holdings that have seen no activity for an extended period. These may include:
            </p>
           
            <li>
            Bank accounts
            </li>
            <li>
            Mutual fund investments
            </li>
            <li>
            Insurance policies
            </li>
