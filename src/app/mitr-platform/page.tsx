              In a groundbreaking step aimed at revolutionizing the mutual fund investment sector in India, 
              the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has announced its new project: 
              the MITR (Mutual Fund Investment Tracing and Retrieval Assistant) platform. 
              This innovative service aims to tackle a long-standing problem in the financial sector—
              the issue of tracing and recovering unclaimed mutual fund investments.
            </blockquote>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Understanding the Need for MITR</h2>
            <p>
              A large number of mutual fund investors have, over the years, become estranged from their investments.
              This usually happens in the case of investments done in physical mode with minimal KYC data or outdated investor data.
              In certain instances, such investments go unnoticed in open-ended growth option schemes, inaccessible to unitholders due 
              to non-availability of KYC details such as PAN or valid email IDs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to address this growing issue, SEBI has launched the MITR platform, which will be an 
              industry-level searchable database of inactive and unclaimed mutual fund folios.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Major Features of the MITR Platform</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Holistic Database:</strong> The MITR platform will aggregate data from various Asset Management Companies (AMCs), creating a common repository for unclaimed investments.</li>
              <li><strong>Friendly Interface:</strong> The platform will be accessible across MF Central, AMC websites, and AMFI portals.</li>
              <li><strong>Enhanced Search Facility:</strong> Investors can trace old or forgotten investments in their name or identify investments they are legally entitled to.</li>
              <li><strong>KYC Compliance Encouragement:</strong> MITR aims to reduce non-compliant folios by persuading investors to provide updated KYC details.</li>
              <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> Security features have been incorporated to prevent fraudulent redemptions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">How MITR Will Benefit Investors</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Defining Inactive Folios</h2>
            <p>
              SEBI defines an inactive folio as a mutual fund account in which no investor-initiated financial or 
              non-financial transactions have occurred in the last 10 years but still has a balance in units.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Implementation Timeline and Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
              The MITR platform will be co-hosted by CAMS and KFIN Technologies, two of India’s leading Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs).
              The beta version is expected to launch in a few months, followed by a two-month testing phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              For widespread adoption, SEBI has instructed AMCs, RTAs, and mutual fund distributors to actively promote awareness of the platform.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Industry Impact and Future Prospects</h2>
            <p>The launch of MITR is likely to have long-term impacts on the mutual fund industry:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
