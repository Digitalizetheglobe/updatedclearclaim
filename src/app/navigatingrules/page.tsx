            <p>
              While these new nomination rules are a positive step towards
              better account management, it’s crucial to understand what happens
              when accounts become dormant and funds remain unclaimed.

              What is a Dormant Bank Account?
            </h2>
            <p>
              A bank account is typically classified as dormant if there have
              been no transactions for a continuous period of two years.{" "}

                After two years of inactivity, the account is classified as
                dormant.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>The subsequent stage is the Unclaimed Stage:</b>If the
                account remains inactive for ten years, the funds are classified
                as “unclaimed.”

                Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Understanding DEAF (Depositor
