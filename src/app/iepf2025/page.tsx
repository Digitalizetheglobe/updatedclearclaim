              Understanding IEPF and Unclaimed Assets
            </h2>
            <p>
              The Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) is a government
              scheme that is aimed at safeguarding the interest of investors.
              Dividends or shares, if they lie unclaimed for seven continuous
              years, are then shifted to the IEPF. This serves the purpose that
              such funds dont get accumulated with companies in perpetuity and
              can be claimed by rightful holders or their heirs in case the
              original owners can not.
